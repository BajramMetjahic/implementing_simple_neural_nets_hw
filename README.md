# Implementing Simple Neural Networks Homework

This file was my submission for a homework for my class 85-426: Learning in Humans and Machines with Dr. Dan Yurovsky. I decided to put this on my public GitHub because it was a really cool assignment that forced me to really understand how both the perceptron and backpropagation models of learning worked under the hood, which is the crux of modern deep learning.
